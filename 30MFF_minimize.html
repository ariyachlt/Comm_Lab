                Baby Yoda may appear cute but he may be even more powerful than Yoda in some key ways. We've seen him use Force Choke like Darth Vader, 
                heal beings with the Force, and lift objects in The Mandalorian. Today, Baby Yoda tackles a new challenge â€“ the Rubik's cube. Observe as Baby Yoda 
                takes his time to examine the cube. Most of us would have picked it up right away and begin to attempt to solve it. But Baby Yoda is patient. He takes 
                his time to study the placement of each color. Once he has the algorithm in his mind, he uses the Force to solve it in one swift movement. He still 
                has a lot to learn but we have more to fear. Baby Yoda may appear cute but he may be even more powerful than Yoda in some key ways.
