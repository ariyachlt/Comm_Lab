# Communications Lab

## Course Description
Communications Lab is a production based course that surveys various technologies including web development, sound, 2D design, digital imaging, video, effects and animation. The forms and uses of these communications technologies are explored in a laboratory context of experimentation, collaboration, and discussion. Much of class time will be spent introducing and playing with equipment and software essential to media production and contemporary storytelling. Each technology is examined as a tool that can be employed and utilized in a variety of situations and experiences. Students will gain fundamental experience thinking, writing, and producing across a variety of media. The world wide web will serve as the primary environment for content delivery and user-interaction. Principles of interpersonal communications and media theory are also introduced with an emphasis on storytelling fundamentals, user-­centered design, and interactivity. Outside of the classroom, students will work both individually and in assigned groups on a variety of assignments. Each major assignment will have a written and practical component. In sum, students will be expected to complete weekly readings, homework exercises, four major group assignments, and one final web portfolio project.

## 30MFF Documentation
#### Project Name: "30MFF: This is the way"
#### Project Description:
For this assignment, I had to create a webpage to showcase the video my group made for the 30MFF in-class project. The project is a video that was filmed in 30 minutes, and edited in 30 minutes. After spending some time brainstorming, our group decided to create a video of Baby Yoda using the Force to solve a Rubik's cube. In the video, Baby Yoda examines the cube before attempting to solve it without touching it (by using the Force). The cube was solved using an adaptation of stop motion where instead of all frames being taken from the exact angle there is variation. This change in perspective is similar to when you actually try to solve a rubiks cube by hand – having to turn it around and look at it from different angles.

Our group wanted to create a short film that was different, experimental but also entertaining to watch and a little mysterious. Baby Yoda and his powers are pretty well known but it has never been used in this context before. We wanted to make it appear as if he was using his strong abilities in the Force to "tackle" the Rubik's cube the way he can use it against enemies. Through this short film, we hope to create a sense of mystery and a little bit of tension that comes with examining a "foreign object" for the first time (where the highest point of tension and excitement is during the problem solving process) and a feeling of satisfaction and content once the mystery (cube) has been solved. It can also be seen as a little play on how the Rubik's cube is seen and understood by those who know how it works and those who don't. As someone who knows how to solve the cube, I may not find the cube as mysterious as those who do not understand how it works. Nevertheless, it is still a fascinating object considering the complexity and simplicity of algorithms that can be used to solve it. We also hope to demonstraste how powerful Baby Yoda's powers are by showing that he can easily solve a Rubik's cube after a few seconds of careful examination whereas most of us take much longer to learn how to solve it.

The webpage aims to capture the feelings evoked by watching the film. It is tense and mysterious but structured and not dark or scary. It should remain light, colorful and exciting.

#### Process
In the beginning of the film, we took out time to build up some tension and mystery by using different camera angles and zoom techniques on the cube. The film opens with a shot of the cube being zoomed into with no caption or explanation to introduce the object while creating a sense of mystery. Since the cube is the first thing we see in the film, it must be important. But no explanation was offered as to why. We then transition into a shot where Baby Yoda's shadow appear to show that he has spotted the cube and he slowly creeps up to it. Movements are kept slow to aid in the tension-building process. We then played with a couple of different camera angles showing Baby Yoda investigating the cube and going through a decision process. The zoom into his ginormous eyes marks the point where he has made a decision about how he will tackle the cube and solve its mystery.
